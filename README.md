# OIM3600_Final_Project
 This is the repo of final project by Carina Hu & Annie Zhang


1. Project Overview
Briefly describe the purpose and functionality of your web application.
Using WeatherAPI, allow users to enter a city name to generate the weather, and then use OpenAI to recommend travel locations and suggest what to wear or bring based on the weather.

2. Usage Guidelines
Explain how users can interact with your application, including any input requirements or steps to follow.
User can input a city they want to travel to/ curious about in the search box and click on "Get Recommendation" to get the weather and recommendation on what to wear based on the weather.

3. Dependencies
List any external libraries, APIs, tools and database that your project depends on.
Fast API, OpenWeather and OpenAI API

4. Project Structure
Give a high-level overview of your project's structure, outlining key files and directories.


5. Collaboration Information (if applicable)
If you collaborated on the project, specify how collaboration was managed, including roles and responsibilities.
Carina was responsible for the database, creating the basic python file to get weather and recommendations.
Annie was responsible for the user interface.

6. Acknowledgments
Credit any external resources, libraries, or APIs that you used in your project.

7. Reflection
Reflect on the project experience, focusing on both the process and learning perspectives. Consider what went well, challenges faced, and how this experience can benefit you in future projects. While the reflection can cover any aspects meaningful to you, feel free to draw insights from areas such as project planning, problem-solving, or using GenAI tools like ChatGPT.

Working on this project has been a great learning experience for us. While we had some wins, we also faced a fair share of challenges. Along the way, we learned a lot about problem-solving, collaboration, and even how to make better use of GenAI tools.

One thing that worked out well was our persistence. Even when we hit roadblocks, we kept pushing through and used AI to guide us when we got stuck. It was really helpful for outlining files and figuring out some tricky errors. By the end, we were able to get everything working and learned a lot in the process. Some of the challenges we faced for example, In main.py, we had trouble with how we assigned the WeatherAPI to the client. The API wouldn’t retrieve the data, and it took a while to figure out why. Eventually, we realized it was because of the way we named things. Once we renamed it, things started to work. Additionally, We also ran into issues when trying to link the style files to main.py. For some reason, the styles wouldn’t show up properly, or they didn’t look the way we wanted. This was frustrating, but after some trial and error, we managed to fix it. 

Some of our key takeaways is that while ChatGPT helped us a lot, we noticed that it’s not always easy to understand the suggestions if you don’t fully understand the code. Sometimes, we ended up feeling more lost because we weren’t sure what the AI was doing. It’s great when you have enough knowledge to guide it, but without that, it can make things trickier. Debugging is definitely not easy, but it’s part of the process. We learned that taking a step back and looking at everything more carefully really helps. Also, using clear and consistent naming for variables can save a lot of time. Collaboration was one of the biggest learning curves. Working together on a coding project isn’t always easy because we had to make sure we understood each other’s code. It took some effort, but it got better as we went along.
